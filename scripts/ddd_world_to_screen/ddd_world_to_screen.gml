/// Returns the position on the screen where the position in world space would appear. The output
/// position may be be out of the bounds of the screen. The input coordinates should be in world
/// space. You must provide a view and projection matrix but you do not have to provide a world
/// matrix (use `undefined` to not use a world matrix). Despite the name, this function can be used
/// with surfaces etc. so long as the "screen" width/height are the size of the surface.
/// 
/// This function returns a four-element array that contains the x/y/z and w vector components. The
/// x/y coordinates measured in pixels and are aligned to the top-left of the screen with `0, 0`
/// being the top-left corner and `screenWidth,screenHeight` being the bottom-right corner. The z
/// coordinate is normalized such that a value of `0` is at the z-near clipping plane and a value
/// of `1` is that the z-fa clipping plane (a value outside of the range `0` to `1` is therefore
/// outside the frustrum and typically not visible during rendering).
///
